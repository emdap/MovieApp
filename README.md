## Good Movies
This is a webapp that uses data from https://www.themoviedb.org to generate lists of popular and top rated movies! Good Movies is designed to use on your phone, and has not yet been optimized for desktop use. 

To use this app, you will need to get your own API key from themoviedb website. Instructions for how to do so are below in [Using your own API key](#using-your-own-api-key). Once you've cloned this directory, your API key is set up and the config file updated, continue to [project setup](#project-setup) for instructions to start the webapp.

## Project Features
- View posters of popular movies
- View posters of top rated movies
- Click into movie posters to get more details
- Mark different movies as favorites, and view a list of your favorites
- Staggered API calls to themoviedb to keep under the rate limit

## Coming soon
- Tests! This project was generated with the capability to run Jest tests, and has a placeholder folder
- Better rate-limit handling so that more movies are shown faster
- Ability to load additional movies after the initial 20 for popular/top rated
- CSS changes for use on desktop
- Dynamic movie poster/thumbnail image fetching to get the best size for the current screen resolution


## Running this project

### Using your own API key:
- Create a config.js file in the parent directory (same directory as package.json)
- Add this as the contents:

}
```
- Save and you're all set!
